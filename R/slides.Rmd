What this talk is

- Crash Course in R & the *tidyverse*, with an emphasis on `{dplyr}`

What this talk isn't

- Not enough to make you fluent (sorry!)

Part 1

- Single-table verbs for working with data in a tidy fashion
- data: [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

Part 2

- Two-table verbs; merging and summarizing data
- data: Aggregated personality data from US States [(Rentfrow et al. (2013))](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0034434.pdf)

## Getting R & RStudio

- Installing R
  - https://r-project.org/
  - You can download the executable for installing R from one of the mirrors, such as Microsoft's
  - https://cran.microsoft.com/

- If you want to try out R, please, please, please use RStudio!
  - RStudio is an IDE (a specialized text editor) that makes working with R (and other commonly used languages for working with data) much easier
  - https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

# Part 1 | Meet {dplyr} & the {tidyverse}

## `{dplyr}` {.build}

**Goals when working with data**

1. Figure out what you want
2. Describe the steps as code
3. Run the code

- `{dplyr}` uses expressive "verbs" that correspond to common tasks
- Encourages thinking about data manipulation challenges in a consistent way

## `{dplyr}`'s "verbs"

- *Rows*
  - `filter()` chooses rows based on values in columns
  - `slice()` chooses rows based on location
  - `arrange()` changes the order of rows
- *Columns*
  - `select()` changes whether or not a column is included
  - `rename()` changes the names of columns
  - `mutate()` adds new columns to the data, or alters existing columns
- *Groups of Rows*
  - `group_by()` creates a *grouped* data frame
  - `summarize()` uses a summary function to collapse a group into a 1 row

## Interlude: the Pipe Operator `%>%` {.build}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
drink(pour(brew(fill_tin(grind_coffee(who = me, beans = "DT House-Blend")), mins = 5)))
```

- nested, have to work from the inside out to understand the result

```{r, eval = FALSE}
me %>%
  grind_coffee(beans = "DT House-Blend") %>%
  fill_tin() %>%
  brew(mins = 5) %>%
  pour() %>%
  drink()
```

- `%>%` allows you to write code sequentially
- `f(x, y)` is equivalent to `x %>% f(y)`
- You can read the pipe operator as "and then" in your code

<div class = "notes">
- doing commands one at a time is fine, but I'll be using the pipe throughout the remainder of the pres
</div>

## Our First Commands: Loading Libraries & Data

- Only run once: `install.package("tidyverse")`!
- When ready to use: `library(tidyverse)`

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

glimpse(penguins)
```

<div class="notes">
- Penguins data is loaded automatically from the package, but we'll cover importing basic data in part 2.

- Our first dplyr function: glimpse()
  - we can see the dimensions of our dataset
  - column names & data types
  - preview of what the contents of each column looks like
  
- Many functions in the tidyverse have expressive & hopefully memorable names that get across what they're for
</div>

## Subsetting data with `filter()` {.build}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# only Adelie penguins
filter(penguins, species == "Adelie")

# Adelie *OR* Gentoo
filter(penguins, species == "Adelie" | species == "Gentoo")

# this gets us the same result as above
filter(penguins, species %in% c("Adelie", "Gentoo"))

# multiple conditions can be added using commas
filter(penguins, bill_length_mm >= 45.8, year == 2007)
```

- Operators for establishing logical conditions:
  - Equal/Not equal to: `!=`, `==`
  - Greater than/less than: `>` & `<`, `>=` & `<=`
  - And/Or: `&`, `|`
  - In: `%in%`

<div class = "notes">
When our condition is based on a string, you need to wrap the entry in quotation marks
</div>

## Pulling out rows by position with `slice()`

```{r}
slice(penguins, 1:3)

slice(penguins, c(1, 33, 2))
```

## `slice()` contd. {.build}

```{r}
slice_min(penguins, bill_length_mm, n = 3)

slice_sample(penguins, n = 3)
```


## Picking out columns of interest using `select()` {.build}

```{r}
penguins

penguins %>% select(species, island, body_mass_g)
```

## `select()` contd. {.build}

```{r}
penguins %>% select(species, island, mass_grams = body_mass_g)
```

## `select()` helpers: `ends_with()` & friends (1/2) {.build}

```{r}
penguins %>% select(species, ends_with("_mm")) %>% slice(1:3)

penguins %>% select(species, contains("length")) %>% slice(1:3)
```

## `select()` helpers: `ends_with()` & friends (2/2) {.build}

```{r}
penguins %>% select(species, body_mass_g:year) %>% slice(1:3)

penguins %>% select(-species, -(body_mass_g:year)) %>% slice(1:3)
```

## `rename()`: hopefully self-explanatory :)

```{r}
# new names go to the left of the '=', old names on the right
# separate arguments by commas! (note: alignment doesn't matter, but looks cleaner)
penguins %>%
  rename(
    isle_name   = island,
    bill_len    = bill_length_mm,
    bill_depth  = bill_depth_mm,
    flipper_len = flipper_length_mm,
    mass_grams  = body_mass_g
  )
```

## Sorting rows with `arrange()` {.build}

```{r}
penguins %>% select(island, species, bill_length_mm) %>% arrange(island, bill_length_mm)

penguins %>% select(island, species, bill_length_mm) %>% arrange(desc(bill_length_mm))
```

## Adding and updating columns with `mutate()` {.build}

```{r}
# all together now! chaining the verbs together...
penguins %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(desc(island)) %>%
  select(species, island, bill_length_mm) %>%
  ### <b>
  mutate(bill_len_sqrt = sqrt(bill_length_mm)) %>%
  ### </b>
  slice(1:7)
```

## `mutate()` contd. {.build}

```{r}
# maybe the log of bill length times depth is important? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    bill_ld     = bill_length_mm * bill_depth_mm,
    ### <b>
    bill_ld_log = log(bill_ld)
    ### </b>
  ) %>%
  select(species, starts_with("bill"))
```

## Counting & summarizing: `count()` {.build}

<div class="columns-2">
```{r}
count(penguins, island, species)
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(year == 2007 | year == 2008) %>%
  count(island, species)
```

</div>

## Counting & summarizing: `group_by()` {.build}

<div class = "columns-2">

```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  filter(
    year == 2007 | year == 2008,
    n() > 100
  ) %>%
  count(island, species)
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  filter(year == 2007 | year == 2008) %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  ### <b>
  filter(n() > 100) %>%
  ### </b>
  count(island, species)
```

</div>

## Counting & summarizing: `summarize()` {.build}

```{r, message = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  group_by(species, island) %>%
  summarize(
    n_penguins   = n(),
    avg_bill_len = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),   # tell R to ignore missing data
    med_bill_len = median(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_bill_len  = sd(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

# Part 2: Merging Data

## The `{nycflights13}` dataset

<font size="2">From Chapter 13 of "R for Data Science" by Wickham & Grolemund</font>

## Does the age of a plane lead to more delays?

```{r}
library(nycflights13)

flights %>% select(tailnum, year, month, day, dep_delay) %>% slice(1:3)

planes %>% select(tailnum, year, type, manufacturer) %>% slice(1:3)
```

## Outer Joins

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height="20%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/join-outer.png")
```
<font size="2">Image from "R 4 Data Science"</font>

## Back to R: `left_join()` {.build}

There are `r nrow(flights)` flights recorded in the data, but only `r nrow(planes)` planes.

```{r}
with_planes <- flights %>%
  select(tailnum, flight_year = year, dep_delay) %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")

with_planes
```

## Answering our question (1/2)

```{r}
with_planes <- with_planes %>% mutate(service_years = flight_year - year)

count(with_planes, service_years)
```

## Answering our question (2/3)

```{r}
with_planes %>%
  mutate(service_qtile = ntile(service_years, 4)) %>%
  group_by(service_qtile) %>%
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay))
```

## Answering our question (3/3)

```{r}
with_planes %>%
  mutate(service_qtile = ntile(service_years, 4)) %>%
  group_by(service_qtile) %>%
  ### <b>
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ### </b>
  arrange(desc(avg_delay))
```

## "Filtering" Joins

`semi_join()`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height="20%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/join-semi.png")
```

`anti_join()`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.height="20%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/join-anti.png")
```
